This assignment is not graded. However, Assignment 1 will build on it, so it is recommended that you complete it.

In this assignment, you will model the health of a cohort of 10,000 individuals over 20 years. Your model will have three health states: Healthy, Sick, and Dead. Individuals will all start healthy, but as time progresses some will get sick and some will die. You will generate a cohort trace plot that shows the percent of individuals in each health state. You will also learn about data validation, scenario analysis, and use the model to conduct a simple health policy analysis.
