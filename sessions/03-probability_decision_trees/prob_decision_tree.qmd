-   Decision trees

## What is probability?

Relative frequency: long run average over many repetitions

<br>

<br>

Measure of belief: how likely is the outcome?

## Sample space and events

**Sample space:** set of all possible outcomes

**Event:** one outcome or a set of outcomes (subset of sample space)

## Axioms of probability 1 & 2

1.  Probability of an event is between 0 (can't happen) and 1 (will definitely happen)

$$ 0 \leq P(e) \leq 1 $$

2.  Some event in the sample space must occur

$$
P(S) = 1
$$

## Axiom 3: Mutually exclusive

For **mutually exclusive** (or 'disjoint') events $e_1$, $e_2$, ... $e_I$:

$$
P(\cup_{i=1}^{I} e_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{I} P(e_i)
$$

The probability any of the mutually exclusive events occurs it the sum of the events' individual probabilities

## Expected value of a random variable

Long run average value from repeated experiments

**Discrete** variable $x$ with $I$ possible values $x_i$

$$
E[x] = \sum_{i=1}^I x_iP(x_i)
$$

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Continuous** variable $x$

$$
E[x] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x)dx

## Conditional probability

-   Prob. of $A$ occurring **conditioned on** $B$ having occurred (probability $A$ **given** $B$):

$$
P(A \mid B)=\frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}
$$

-   Can condition on multiple events:

$$
P(A \mid B,C,D,E) = \frac{P(A,B,C,D,E)}{P(B,C,D,E)}
$$

## Conditional probability visualized

'Rescaling' the sample space to account for B occurring

## Conditional independence

A and B are independent conditioned on C iff

$$
P(A \cap B \mid C) = P( A \mid C) \times P( B \mid C)
$$

K A and B independent
