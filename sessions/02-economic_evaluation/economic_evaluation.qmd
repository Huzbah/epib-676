## Logistics

-   Assignment 0 due next Wednesday 1/11

-   Assignment 1 available (due Wednesday 1/18)

## Today

-   **Decision analytic frameworks**

-   Quantifying health

-   Quantifying costs

-   Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)

## Purpose of decision models

Clarify important elements of decision

-   **Alternatives:** What can I do?

-   **Information:** What do I know?

-   **Preferences:** What do I value?

-   **Uncertainty:** How sure can I be?

Provide insight to inform or guide decision making

## Choosing decision analytic framework

![](images/choosing_eval_type_table.png)

**Not shown:** Equity-informative frameworks (more later)

## Today

-   Decision analytic frameworks

-   **Quantifying health**

-   Quantifying costs

-   Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)

## Example health measures

Examples?

## Example health measures

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Life years gained

HIV cases averted

Blood pressure reduction

Cholesterol reduction

Number of adverse events

Cases detected

Percent infected in treatment
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Episode-free days

Reduction in pain scale

Reduction in emergency room visits or readmissions

Survey-based score (e.g., overall health, anxiety)

...

## Choice of health measure

**Context-specific** measures work within narrow context

-   Blood pressure medication → mmHg blood pressure

-   Hepatitis B screening strategies → % cases detected

-   HIV antivirals → % with high CD4 level

**General measures** let you compare across contexts

-   Life years gained

-   Quality-adjusted life years gained

## Net present value

-   Benefits in further into future valued less (why?)

-   Net present value of quantity $Q$, $t$ years into the future, with a discount rate $r$:

$$
NPV = Q \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$

```{r}
#| echo: true

Q=100 #dollars
t = 5 #years into the future
r = .05 #5 percent discount rate
NPV <- Q*(1/(1+r)^t)

NPV
```

## Discounted life expectancy (DLE)

-   Life years gained today valued more than life years gained in future

$$
DLE = \sum_{t=0}^T LY_t \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$

$LY_t$ is life-years experienced at time t. The rest is the discounting multiplier for an annual discount rate of $r$ (typically \~ 0% to 7%)

## Quality-adjusted life expectancy

-   Health-related utility weight $u_t$

    -   1 = in perfect health

    -   0 = dead

$$
QALE = \sum_{t=0}^T u_tLY_t \frac{1}{(1+r)^t}
$$

## How are health related utility weights estimated?

Reflect societal or patient preference. Many elicitation methods

-   Standard gamble

-   Time trade off

-   Discrete choice experiments

-   Survey-based instruments (EQ-5D, SD6)

    -   Often used for trial-based decision analysis

## Where modelers find utility weights

-   Search the literature

-   [The Cost-Effectiveness Registry](https://cevr.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/databases/cea-registry) from Tufts Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health

-   [Global Burden of Disease Study](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2019-disability-weights) (for disability weights in DALY studies)

If no publish estimate available:

-   Pick something similar as a proxy

-   Do thorough sensitivity analysis

## Today

-   Decision analytic frameworks

-   Quantifying health

-   **Quantifying costs**

-   Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)

## What matters?

***Differences*** in costs, not total cost

Typically

-   Cost of the intervention(s) themselves

-   'Downstream' costs that differ due to intervention

## Discounting costs

## Where to find cost values?

## Currency exchange

## Adjust for inflation

## Productivity costs

## Medical costs unrelated to intervention

## Today

-   Decision analytic frameworks

-   Quantifying health

-   Quantifying costs

-   **Incremental analysis (cost-effectiveness)**

## Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio

## Dominance

## Efficiency frontier plot

## Willingness to pay

## Net monetary benefit
