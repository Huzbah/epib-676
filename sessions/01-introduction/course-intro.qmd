## About me

-   Born in North Carolina
-   Engineering at NC State (BSc) and Stanford (MSc, PhD)
-   Joined the School of Population and Global Health in January 2022
-   Teach PPHS 528 Economic evaluation of health programs in the fall
-   Lead the [Decision Modeling Lab](http://mchi.mcgill.ca/decision-modeling-lab/)

## Agenda for today

-   **Why decision analysis**
-   Course overview
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   Perspective and audiences

## Why decision analysis?

-   Demand for health resources nearly infinite
-   Resources (budgets) are limited
-   Choices must be made!

## Opportunity cost

*The value of the next-best thing I could have done with the resources*

-   Each dollar spent on PrEP to prevent HIV in people who inject drugs cannot be spent on photon radiation for children with cancer, etc.

-   Each dollar spent on health care cannot be spent on education, infrastructure, defense, etc.

## Challenges in global health

## Challenges in global health

-   High childhood mortality
-   Epidemics of infectious diseases
-   Poor health infrastructure
-   Limited access to care
-   Limited funds for disease prevention and treatment

## Challenges in Canada

## Challenges in Canada

-   Aging boomers
    -   50% of health care expenses incurred in last year of life
-   Chronic health conditions
-   Insufficient capacity -\> long queues
-   Total joints, screening colonoscopy, etc.

## How do we decide what to pay for?

## How do we decide what to pay for?

-   Cost
-   Effectiveness
-   Efficiency
-   Fairness

## Key questions for decision analysis

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?
-   How can these services be delivered most efficiently?

## Key questions for decision analysis

**Health policy**

-   What services should we pay for? 
-   Who should receive these services?

**Healthcare operations**

-   How can these services be delivered most efficiently? 

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (cost, effects, efficiency, fairness)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  Estimate outcomes under each alternative

5.  Perform sensitivity analysis

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret the results

## Decision-analytic model


-  Function mapping inputs (data, parameters) into estimated outcomes for two or more alternatives
-  Propagate uncertainty (uncertain inputs -> uncertain outputs)

## Decision analysis can...

-  Estimate monetary and nonmonetary consequences of alternatives
-  Suport decisions about investment into programs or design of programs
-  Help guide allocation of resources
-  Provide insights with incomplete data (requires assumptions)
-  Inform data collection/research


## Decision analysis can't...

-  Perfectly capture reality
-  Account for unknown factors
-  Replace a decision maker

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   **Course overview**
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   Perspective and audiences

## Learning objectives

-   Develop decision analytic models to inform health policy and clinical decisions
-   Understand and critically appraise published model-based decision analyses
-   Create transparent reports of decision analyses that conform to open science principles

## Course materials

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   **Using R for decision analysis**
-   Perspective and audiences

## Software for building models

-   TreeAge <https://www.treeage.com/>
-   Excel
-   Python, Julia, Matlab, etc.
-   R

## Why I like R

-   Code-based easier to interrogate + version control
    -   Downside of Excel, TreeAge
-   Free and open source, design for data science
-   Ecosystem of packages, tutorials, vignettes
-   Community of useRs
    -   Decision Analyysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) ([Website](https://darthworkgroup.com/), [Github](https://github.com/DARTH-git))
    -   R for Health Technology Assessment ([Website](https://r-hta.org/))
-   Tools for creating reproducible research reports

## Downsides of R

-   Not as fast
    -   Julia, C++, Matlab faster
    -   RCPP package can integrate R with C++
-   Dependence
    -   Crowdsourcing = packages may not be maintained
    -   Functionality changes after updates

## RStudio tour

-   Create R project
-   Create Quarto document
-   Download and start assignment 0

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   **Perspective and audiences**

## Who is the audience?
-  Public health
-  Regulators
-  Clinicians / Medical societies
-  Patients
-  Patient parent/guardian
-  Insurance companies
-  Organization leaders (admin of hospital, blood collectors)
-  Funding agencies (e.g., CIHR)
-  etc.

Depends on context; often multiple target audiences

## Perspective motivated by audience


## The case for societal perspective

## Costs and perspectives


## The case for multiple perspectives
