## Why decision analysis?

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Demand for health resources nearly infinite
-   Resources (budgets) are limited
-   Choices must be made!

## Opportunity cost

*The value of the next-best thing I could have done with the resources*

-   Each dollar spent on PrEP to prevent HIV in people who inject drugs cannot be spent on photon radiation for children with cancer, etc.

-   Each dollar spent on health care cannot be spent on education, infrastructure, defense, etc.

## Challenges in global health

## Challenges in global health

-   High childhood mortality
-   Epidemics of infectious diseases
-   Poor health infrastructure
-   Limited access to care
-   Limited funds for disease prevention and treatment

## Challenges in Canada

## Challenges in Canada

-   Aging boomers
    -   50% of health care expenses incurred in last year of life
-   Chronic health conditions
-   Insufficient capacity → long queues for services
    -   Joint replacements, colonoscopy, emergency rooms, etc.

## How do we decide what to pay for?

*Decision criteria*

## How do we decide what to pay for?

*Decision criteria*

-   Cost
-   Effectiveness
-   Efficiency
-   Fairness

## Key questions for decision analysis

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?
-   How can these services be delivered most efficiently?

## Key questions for decision analysis

**Health policy**

-   What services should we pay for?
-   Who should receive these services?

**Healthcare operations**

-   How can these services be delivered most efficiently?

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (cost, effects, efficiency, fairness)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  Estimate outcomes under each alternative

5.  Perform sensitivity analysis

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret the results

## Developing a decision analysis

1.  Define the decision context

2.  Identify outcomes of interest (cost, effects, efficiency, fairness)

3.  Identify alternatives

4.  **Estimate outcomes under each alternative → Modeling**

5.  **Perform sensitivity analysis → Modeling**

6.  Consider non-quantifiable factors

7.  Interpret the results

## Decision-analytic model

-   Function mapping inputs (data, parameters) into estimated outcomes for two or more alternatives
-   Propagate uncertainty
    -   Uncertain inputs → uncertain outputs

![](model-inputs-outputs.svg)

## Decision analysis can...

-   Estimate monetary and nonmonetary consequences of alternatives
-   Suport decisions about investment into/design of programs
-   Inform allocation of resources
-   Provide insights with incomplete data (requires assumptions)
-   Inform data collection/research

## Decision analysis can't...

-   Perfectly capture reality
-   Account for unknown factors
-   Replace a decision maker

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   **Course overview**
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   Perspective and audiences

## Learning objectives

-   Develop decision analytic models to inform health policy and clinical decisions
-   Understand and critically appraise published model-based decision analyses
-   Create transparent reports of decision analyses that conform to open science principles

## EPIB 676 vs PPHS 528

-   Economic evaluations often use decision analytic models

    -   Exception: trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis

-   Decision analyses often used for economic evaluation

    -   Exception: decision models without costs

-   **PPHS 528:** economic evaluation, \~15% modeling methods

-   **EPIB 676:** modeling method, \~15% economic evaluation

PPHS 528 is less research oriented and requires less background in programming, probability, and math

## Course materials

**MyCourses** (<https://mycourses2.mcgill.ca/>)

-   Access readings, submit assignments

**Public Github repo** (<https://github.com/altonrus/epib-676>)

-   Everything else
-   To read HTML documents hosted on Github
    -   Download then open in web browser **or**
    -   <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?>

## Two phases

![](birds-eye-view.png)

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
**Methods phase**

-   Read tutorials, textbooks

-   Technical lectures

-   Programming assignments
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
**Application phase**

-   Read applied analyses

-   Guest lectures

-   Build model; analyze open source publication

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   **Using R for decision analysis**
-   Perspective and audiences

## Software for decision-analytic modeling

-   Software programs
    -   TreeAge <https://www.treeage.com/>

    -   Arena, Simio, Simul8

    -   Excel
-   Programming languages
    -   Python, Julia, Matlab, C++, etc.

    -   R

## Why I like R

-   Free and open source, designed for data science
-   Code-based (easier to interrogate + version control)
-   Ecosystem of packages, tutorials, vignettes (others not as mature)
-   Friendly community of useRs
-   Systems for creating reproducible research reports
    -   Quarto documents!

## Packages for decision-analytic modeling in R

-   Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH)
    -   [Website](https://darthworkgroup.com/), [Github](https://github.com/DARTH-git)
-   R for Health Technology Assessment
    -   [Website](https://r-hta.org/)
-   Nathan Green's [List of Health Economics R Packages](https://github.com/n8thangreen/health_economics_R_packages)

## Downsides of R

-   High learning curve for non-programmers (vs. Excel, TreeAge)
-   Not the fastest language
    -   Julia, C++, Matlab faster
    -   **But,** RCPP package can integrate R with C++
-   Dependencies and back/forward compatibility
    -   Packages can have errors, not be maintained
    -   Functionality changes after updates

## Getting started with R

We will:

-   Create a new R project with quarto document
-   Download and render assignment 0
-   \[Optional\] clone the class R project onto your computer

## Agenda for today

-   Why decision analysis
-   Course overview
-   Using R for decision analysis
-   **Perspective and audiences**

## Who is the audience?

## Who is the audience?

-   Public health
-   Regulators
-   Clinicians / Medical societies
-   Patients
-   Patient parent/guardian
-   Insurance companies
-   Organization leaders (admin of hospital, blood collectors)
-   Funding agencies (e.g., CIHR)
-   etc.

Depends on context; often multiple target audiences

## Perspective motivated by audience

-   Payers want to know their own costs

-   Government may also care about societal costs & benefits

    -   Patient time/transportation

    -   Productivity loss from illness or death

    -   Informal care-giving

    -   Spillover into criminal justice, education, etc.

## The case for societal perspective

[First Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine (1996)](https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jama.1996.03540140060028):

> Using CEA to inform allocation of health resources accepts the existence of a limit on health spending; when the **societal perspective** is adopted, the analysis acknowledges the value of competing uses for society's resources

**But**, data on non-health benefits/costs are often lacking

## Why choose just one?

-   1 analysis can have \>1 perspective
-   Typical: societal + healthcare payer
    -   Recommended by [Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness (2016)](https://academic.oup.com/book/12265/chapter-abstract/161760944?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

Reporting disaggregated outcomes (e.g., costs by category) can allow reader to re-calculate according to their perspective.

## The impact inventory

Lists all potentially relevant cost categories and comments on their inclusion
